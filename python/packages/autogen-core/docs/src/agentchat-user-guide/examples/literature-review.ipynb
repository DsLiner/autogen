For testing performance of different algorithms, standardized\\\\nenvironments are designed such as the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which is\\\\none of the most successful MARL benchmarks. To our best knowledge, most of\\\\ncurrent environments are synchronous, where agents execute actions in the same\\\\npace. However, heterogeneous agents usually have their own action spaces and\\\\nthere is no guarantee for actions from different agents to have the same\\\\nexecuted cycle, which leads to asynchronous multi-agent cooperation. Inspired\\\\nfrom the Wargame, a confrontation game between two armies abstracted from real\\\\nworld environment, we propose the first Partially Observable Asynchronous\\\\nmulti-agent Cooperation challenge (POAC) for the MARL community. Specifically,\\\\nPOAC supports two teams of heterogeneous agents to fight with each other, where\\\\nan agent selects actions based on its own observations and cooperates\\\\nasynchronously with its allies. Moreover, POAC is a light weight, flexible and\\\\neasy to use environment, which can be configured by users to meet different\\\\nexperimental requirements such as self-play model, human-AI model and so on.\\\\nAlong with our benchmark, we offer six game scenarios of varying difficulties\\\\nwith the built-in rule-based AI as opponents. Finally, since most MARL\\\\nalgorithms are designed for synchronous agents, we revise several\\\\nrepresentatives to meet the asynchronous setting, and the relatively poor\\\\nexperimental results validate the challenge of POAC.
